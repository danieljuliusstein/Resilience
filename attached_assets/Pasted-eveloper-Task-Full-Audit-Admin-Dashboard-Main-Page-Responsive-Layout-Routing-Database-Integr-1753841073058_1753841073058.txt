eveloper Task: Full Audit ‚Äì Admin Dashboard & Main Page (Responsive Layout, Routing, Database Integration, and Testing) üîß Objective: Ensure both the main landing page and the admin dashboard are fully responsive, correctly routed, properly connected to the database, and tested for full functionality across devices and browsers. ‚úÖ Task Breakdown 1. Responsive Layout Implementation Refactor layout for both the main page and the admin dashboard using mobile-first responsive design principles. Ensure all components (headers, footers, hero sections, navigation bars, cards, tables, sidebars, etc.): Scale appropriately on desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports. Use CSS Flexbox, Grid, or responsive frameworks (Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, etc.). Include proper spacing, wrapping, alignment, and mobile-friendly elements (hamburger menu, collapsible sidebars). 2. Routing and Navigation Main Page: Confirm that all links/buttons (e.g., About, Services, Contact, Login) point to valid routes or anchor sections. Admin Dashboard: Audit all button routes (e.g., /admin/users, /admin/settings, /admin/products, etc.). Fix any broken or misconfigured paths in the routing system. Ensure authenticated routes are protected (if applicable). 3. Database Integration and CRUD Functionality Confirm that all data-related components interact with the database as expected: Main Page: Check newsletter signups, contact forms, or login endpoints. Admin Dashboard: Check user management, item/product CRUD, analytics views, etc. Verify: Data is successfully sent to the backend/database. Data is correctly retrieved from the backend/database. Proper input validation and error handling are in place for all forms and actions. No hard-coded data or placeholder content is present in production views. 4. Testing and Quality Assurance Manual Testing: Click-test all interactive elements across both the main page and admin panel. Test form submissions, navigation, and responsive layout behavior. Cross-device and browser testing: Confirm compatibility on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Test on real or simulated mobile devices (DevTools responsive mode). Optional Automated Testing: Write basic unit or integration tests using Jest/Vitest. Use Cypress or Playwright for UI interaction tests. Use Postman to test all backend endpoints if applicable. üõ°Ô∏è Success Criteria ‚úÖ Main landing page is fully functional and visually consistent on all screen sizes. ‚úÖ Admin dashboard is fully responsive and routes work correctly. ‚úÖ All database interactions (create, read, update, delete) are functional and error-free. ‚úÖ No broken links, 404s, or JavaScript errors. ‚úÖ UI/UX is smooth across devices and tested with both manual and automated tools.
