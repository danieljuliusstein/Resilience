1. DATABASE SETUP (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
Problem: App uses MockStorage instead of real database Solution Steps:

In Replit project, go to Tools panel → Database → Add PostgreSQL
Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable is automatically set
Run npm run db:push to create database tables
Test database connection by checking logs for "Database connection successful, using DatabaseStorage"
Alternative if Replit DB fails:

Go to Secrets tab (lock icon)
Add DATABASE_URL with format: postgresql://username:password@hostname:port/database
2. EMAIL SERVICE CONFIGURATION (HIGH PRIORITY)
Problem: Email notifications only log to console, conflicting email services Current State: Code uses EmailOctopus API but SendGrid package is installed

Choose ONE approach:

Option A - Use EmailOctopus (Recommended - code already implemented):

Add to Secrets: EMAILOCTOPUS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Remove unused SendGrid dependency: npm uninstall @sendgrid/mail
Option B - Switch to SendGrid:

Add to Secrets: SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
Modify server/email.ts to use SendGrid instead of EmailOctopus
Import and implement @sendgrid/mail package
3. ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SETUP (HIGH PRIORITY)
Add these to Replit Secrets:

SESSION_SECRET=generate_a_very_long_random_string_at_least_32_characters_long
ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin_email@domain.com
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
EMAILOCTOPUS_API_KEY=your_api_key (if using EmailOctopus)
4. SECURITY PATCHES (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
Problem: 11 npm vulnerabilities (8 moderate, 3 low) Solution:

npm audit fix
# If that doesn't fix all issues:
npm audit fix --force
5. BUILD OPTIMIZATIONS (LOW PRIORITY)
Problems: Large bundle size, outdated browser data Solutions:

npx update-browserslist-db@latest
Consider implementing code splitting in vite.config.ts for bundle size.

Verification Steps
After Database Setup:
Check server logs for "Database connection successful, using DatabaseStorage"
Visit /database route - should show admin interface with real data
Test creating a lead through contact form - should save to database
After Email Setup:
Test email endpoint: POST /api/test-email
Check logs - should show actual email sending, not console fallback
Submit contact form - admin should receive email notification
After Environment Variables:
Check that session management works properly
Verify admin email receives notifications
Test all form submissions end-to-end
Important Notes
What's Already Working:
✅ All dependencies installed and working
✅ Frontend builds successfully
✅ Server starts and responds
✅ TypeScript compilation passes
✅ All imports and path aliases resolve
✅ MockStorage provides fallback functionality
File Locations:
Database config: server/db.ts, drizzle.config.ts
Email service: server/email.ts, server/email-drip.ts
Environment variables: Use Replit Secrets tab
Database setup docs: DATABASE_SETUP.md
Testing Commands:
# Check dependencies
npm list --depth=0

# Test TypeScript compilation
npm run check

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test database schema
npm run db:push
Common Pitfalls:
Don't modify the MockStorage fallback system - it's working correctly
Don't change path aliases - they're properly configured
Don't install additional dependencies unless specifically needed
The app is designed to gracefully degrade when services are unavailable
Success Criteria
Database connection established and MockStorage → DatabaseStorage switch occurs
Email notifications send successfully (not just console logs)
All environment variables properly configured
No security vulnerabilities remain
Application fully functional for production use
If You Encounter Issues:
Check server logs for specific error messages
Verify environment variables are set in Replit Secrets
Test each component individually (database, email, etc.)
Use the health check endpoint: GET /health
The application is designed to be resilient - it should continue working even if some services fail
